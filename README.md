## Goal

The focus of this project was to create this app using Object Constructors and
being able understand better "Object Constructors" .

## LocalStorage

I was asked to do it locally but it was a fine opportunity to learn and apply
LocalStorage. I learned about the basics of it using the Mozilla documentation
and also learned about JSON _stringify_ and _parse_ methods which made handling the
data extremely easy.

The clean and beautiful layout is thanks to [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/), after I see read some of the people codes exemples.
