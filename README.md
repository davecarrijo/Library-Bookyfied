A library app following I made as a project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

## Goal

The focus of this project was to create this app using Object Constructors and
being able understand better "Object Constructors" .

## LocalStorage

I was asked to do it locally but it was a great opportunity to learn and apply
LocalStorage, so... I did it. I learned about the basics of it using the Mozilla documentation

The clean and beautiful layout is thanks to [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/), after I see read some of the people codes exemples.
